I am a new member of this fall-2019 batch working on my masters in Applied Computer Science.

I was born in Hyderabad and completed my under graduation in the field of Information technology.I had no prior experience in the real practical world and I wish to explore and learn the newly evolving technologies and languages so that I could match my skills with the real competing world. My avocations are playing badminton and surfing social websites.
I wish to work as a cloud engineer which is my major area of interests because it is fascinating to know how huge amount of data generated every data, is stored into the cloud and also the functionality included in it. Apart from these, some of the other interests include developing websites and working on the front-end.
